[mcmc] Getting initial point... (this may take a few seconds)
[model] Measuring speeds... (this may take a few seconds)
[model] Setting measured speeds (per sec): {BB: 7140.0, camb.transfers: 2.01, camb: 23.1}
[mcmc] Covariance matrix not present. We will start learning the covariance of the proposal earlier: R-1 = 30 (would be 2 if all params loaded).
